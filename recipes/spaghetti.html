    <h1>MILLION DOLLAR SPAGHETTI</h1>
    <img src="./IMAGES/spaghetti.jpg" alt="VERY EXPENSIVE SPAGHETTI"height="300" width="400">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Like the hamburger, this spaghetti doesn't involve having 1 million dollars to make. Though I imagine it would be much easier if that were the case. You could probably outsource the whole thing and not even have to read this recipe, but then where would I be?</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti: An 8-ounce package of spaghetti should make about eight servings.</li>
        <li>Beef: Youâ€™ll need a pound of lean ground beef. You can use a mix of ground beef and ground turkey, if you prefer. </li>
        <li>Spaghetti sauce: Use a jar of store-bought spaghetti sauce or make your own marinara sauce at home. </li>
        <li>Butter: Use a stick of sliced butter to prepare the pan and to add richness and flavor to the baked spaghetti. </li>
        <li>Cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream: A mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream is essential for this decadent, creamy spaghetti sauce. (student note: WTF?)</li>
        <li>Cheese: Shredded Cheddar cheese is the perfect finishing touch for this million dollar spaghetti. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Boil the spaghetti in salted water, then drain and set aside. </li>
      <li>Cook the beef on the stove and discard the grease. Transfer to a bowl and mix in the spaghetti sauce. </li>
      <li>Prepare the baking dish, then spread half of the noodles in the bottom. </li>
      <li>Top with the mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream. </li>
      <li>Cover with remaining spaghetti and butter. </li>
      <li>Pour the beef mixture over the spaghetti and spread in an even layer.</li>
      <li>Bake for 30 minutes, top with Cheese, and continue baking until the cheese is melted. </li>
    </ol>
