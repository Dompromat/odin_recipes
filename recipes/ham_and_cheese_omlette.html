    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a wonderfully fluffy three-egg omlette that is easy, fast, and very simple to make. I used a little ham and cheese because I'm a traditionalist, but we can add whatever we like. Thats the fun in omlettes!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 TBsp milk or water</li>
    <li>2-3 slices or 1/4 cup cheese</li>
    <li>about 1/2 cup sliced deli ham</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Begin by prepping your pan by placing it on a medium heat. A little butter or oil will help keep your omlette from sticking, and make your life easier down the road.</li>
    <li>Prepare a small bowl, and crack your eggs into it. Add the milk to the eggs and whisk/beat them until smooth</li>
    <li>Once you're satisfied that the pan has reached a good temperature, pour the eggs on!</li>
    <li>Give it a few moments to set, and then add the cheese. I like to add the cheese at this point as a sort of reinforcement for the eggs</li>
    <li>Once the cheese begins to melt, you're ready to add the ham</li>
    <li>let it cook for about a minute</li>
    <li>take a spatula, and fold the omlette over itself. Depending on the size of the pan, you may want to do a tri-fold by folding either end of the meal toward the middle.</li>
    <li>Let it sit for about another half a minute, then give it a nice flip. It will be easier to tilt the pan, this isn't a four egg omlette after all! (gosh could you imagine?)</li>
    <li>Let it cook for another minute or so. Use the browning you see to gauge how you're doing, it's your omlette after all!</li>
    <li>Plate, add a little salt and pepper (or more if you're feeling bold) and serve!</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
